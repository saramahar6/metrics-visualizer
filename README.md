# metrics-visualizer

Data Science is mostly data cleaning and reporting, with the occasional opportunity to do something creative or insightful.  Imagine you spend an entire two weeks wrestling with poorly encoded data, you build a “pipeline” to feed the now-clean data into a sophisticated off-the-shelf model, and generate predictions that barely beat a coin flip.  Instead of spending another day or two struggling with picking the right metric to convince your bosses that your work matters, we propose a handy-dandy dashboard that will allow the users to  test and play with various metrics...in real-ish time!

The file: `metrics_auto_visualizer.py` is the main script to execute our code.  This will import a function called `plot_metrics` that takes in a trained sklearn Random Forest model and returns the dashboard.
